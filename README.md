## Project Overview

The Street ARTists Platform is designed to help street artists better manage their income and showcase their artwork. It offers various features such as income tracking, item listings, live auctions, and more.

## Features

### Income Tracking

Artists can track their total items sold, total income, and average price per piece. The platform provides statistics that help artists understand their earnings and pricing trends.

### Artwork Showcase

Artists can create profile pages to showcase their masterpieces professionally. They can upload images, provide descriptions, and categorize their artwork by type.

### Live Auctions

The platform simulates live auctions for items. Visitors can participate in bidding, and the system provides a countdown timer, dynamic bidding amounts, and real-time updates.

## Pages

The platform consists of the following pages:

### Landing Page

Choose to join as an artist or visitor. The page displays a clickable div with options to select from multiple artists. Visitors can also choose to explore artist profiles.

### Artist Home Page

Displays the current status of the logged-in artist. Widgets provide information about total items sold, total income, ongoing live auctions, and a dynamic chart showing sales trends.

### Artist Items Page

Allows artists to manage their items. Each item card includes control buttons to send to auction, publish/unpublish, remove, and edit. Artists can also add new items using a dedicated card.

### Auction Page

Simulates live auctioning of items. Visitors can place bids, and the countdown timer displays the time remaining for the auction. The auction continues until the timer reaches zero.

### Visitor Home Page

Allows visitors to explore artist profiles and artwork. The banner features a call-to-action button that leads to the Visitor Listing Page.

### Visitor Listing Page

Lists available items with filters for easy navigation. Visitors can filter items by name, artist, price range, and type. Filtered items are displayed in cards with a responsive design.

## Resources

### Icons

Use Font-Awesome or any other icon library to enhance the user interface with meaningful icons.

### Charting

Utilize Chart.js for creating dynamic charts to visualize statistics and sales trends. Refer to the official [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/) for guidance.

### Fonts

Incorporate the "Reenie Beanie" and "Roboto" fonts from Google Fonts to maintain a consistent and appealing typography.
